# Ports for Elm-Phoenix-WebSocket package

Copy this [Port](https://github.com/phollyer/elm-phoenix-websocket/blob/master/src/Ports/Phoenix.elm)
module into your Elm `src` wherever it makes sense for your project, changing
the module name accordingly.

If you already have a `port` module in use, you can just copy the module code
into your existing `port` module.

Please see the comments in the module, and read the package
[docs](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/phollyer/elm-phoenix-websocket/latest/)
to see how and when they are used.
