# Ports for Elm-Phoenix-WebSocket package

Copy this [Port](https://github.com/phollyer/elm-phoenix-websocket/blob/master/src/Ports/Phoenix.elm)
module into your Elm `src` wherever it makes sense for your project, changing
the module name accordingly.

If you already have a `port` module in use, you can just copy the module code
into your existing `port` module.
