{-| This module is a wrapper around the [Socket](Phoenix.Socket),
[Channel](Phoenix.Channel) and [Presence](Phoenix.Presence) modules. It handles
all the low level stuff with a simple, but extensive API. It automates a few
processes, and generally simplifies working with Phoenix WebSockets.

Once you have installed the package, and followed the simple setup instructions
[here](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/phollyer/elm-phoenix-websocket/latest/),
configuring this module is as simple as this:

    import Phoenix
    import Ports.Phoenix as Ports


    -- Add the Phoenix Model to your Model

    type alias Model =
        { phoenix : Phoenix.Model
        ...
        }


    -- Initialize the Phoenix Model

    init : Model
    init =
        { phoenix =
            Phoenix.init
                Ports.config
                []
        ...
        }


    -- Add a Phoenix Msg

    type Msg
        = PhoenixMsg Phoenix.Msg
        | ...


    -- Handle Phoenix Msgs

    update : Msg -> Model -> (Model Cmd Msg)
    update msg model =
        case msg of
            PhoenixMsg subMsg ->
                let
                    (phoenix, phoenixCmd) =
                        Phoenix.update subMsg model.phoenix
                in
                ( { model | phoenix = phoenix}
                , Cmd.map PhoenixMsg phoenixCmd
                )
            ...


    -- Subscribe to receive Phoenix Msgs

    subscriptions : Model -> Sub Msg
    subscriptions model =
        Sub.map PhoenixMsg <|
            Phoenix.subscriptions
                model.phoenix


# Model

@docs Model


# Initialising the Model

@docs PortConfig, init


# Connecting to the Socket

Connecting to the Socket is automatic on the first [push](#push) to a Channel.
However, if you want to connect before hand, you can use the
[connect](#connect) function.

If you want to set any [ConnectOption](Phoenix.Socket#ConnectOption)s on the
socket you can do so when you [init](#init) the [Model](#Model), or use the
[addConnectOptions](#addConnectOptions) or
[setConnectOptions](#setConnectOptions) functions.

If you want to send any params to the Socket when it connects at the Elixir
end, such as authenticating a user for example, then you can use the
[setConnectParams](#setConnectParams) function.

@docs connect, addConnectOptions, setConnectOptions, Payload, setConnectParams


# Joining a Channel

Joining a Channel is automatic on the first [push](#push) to the Channel.
However, if you want to join before hand, you can use the [join](#join)
function.

If you want to send any params to the Channel when you join at the Elixir end
you can use the [addJoinConfig](#addJoinConfig) function.

@docs Topic, join, Event, JoinConfig, addJoinConfig


# Leaving a Channel

@docs LeaveConfig, leave


# Talking to Channels

When pushing an event to a Channel, opening the Socket, and joining the
Channel is handled automatically. Pushes will be queued until the Channel has
been joined, at which point, any queued pushes will be sent in a batch.

See [Connecting to the Socket](#connecting-to-the-socket) and
[Joining a Channel](#joining-a-channel) for more details on handling connecting
and joining manually.

If the Socket is open and the Channel already joined, the push will be sent
immediately.

## Debugging and Error Handling


### Logging

Here you can log data to the console, and activate and deactive the socket's
logger, but be warned, **there is no safeguard when you compile** such as you
get when you use `Debug.log`. Be sure to deactive the logging before you deploy
to production.

However, the ability to easily toggle logging on and off leads to a possible
use case where, in a deployed production environment, an admin is able to see
all the logging, while regular users do not.

{- Talking to Channels -}


{-| The retry strategy to use if a push times out.

  - `Drop` - Drop the push and don't try again.

  - `Every second` - The number of seconds to wait between retries.

  - `Backoff [List seconds] (Maybe max)` - A backoff strategy enabling you to increase
    the delay between retries. When the list has been exhausted, `max` will be
    used for each subsequent attempt, if max is `Nothing`, the push will then
    be dropped, which is useful if you want to limit the number of retries.

        Backoff [ 1, 5, 10, 20 ] (Just 30)

{-| A type alias representing the config for pushing a message to a Channel.

  - `topic` - The Channel topic to send the push to.

  - `event` - The event to send to the Channel.

  - `payload` - The params to send with the push. If you don't need to send
    any params, set this to
    [Json.Encode.null](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/json/latest/Json-Encode#null).
    I decided not to make this a `Maybe` because it is expected that most of
    the time something will be sent.

  - `timeout` - Optional timeout in milliseconds to set on the push request.

  - `retryStrategy` - The retry strategy to use if the push times out.

  - `ref` - Optional reference you can provide that you can later use to
    identify the push. This is useful when using functions that need to find
    the push in order to do their thing, such as [dropPush](#dropPush) or
    [pushTimeoutCountdown](#pushTimeoutCountdown).

  - `id` - The `id` used to identify the Presence map in the
    [Presence.track/3](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Presence.html#c:track/3)
    Elixir function. The recommended approach is to use the users' `id`.

  - `metas`- A list of metadata as stored in the
    [Presence.track/3](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Presence.html#c:track/3)
    function.

  - `user` - The user data that is pulled from the DB and stored on the
    Presence in the
    [fetch/2](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Presence.html#c:fetch/2)
    Elixir callback function. This is the recommended approach for storing user
    data on the Presence. If
    [fetch/2](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Presence.html#c:fetch/2) is
    not being used then `user` will be equal to
    [Json.Encode.null](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/json/latest/Json-Encode#null).

  - `presence` - The whole Presence map. This provides a way to access any
    additional data that is stored on the Presence.

In order to receive any output in the console, you first need to activate the
socket's logger. There are two ways to do this. You can use the
[startLogging](#startLogging) function, or you can pass the `Logger True`
[ConnectOption](#Phoenix.Socket#ConnectOption) to the [init](#init) function.

    import Phoenix
    import Phoenix.Socket exposing (ConnectOption(..))
    import Ports.Phoenix as Ports

    init : Model
    init =
        { phoenix =
            Phoenix.init
                Ports.config
                [ Logger True ]
        ...
        }

log : String -> String -> Value -> Model -> Cmd Msg
log kind msg data (Model model) =
    Socket.log kind msg data model.portConfig.phoenixSend


{-| Activate the socket's logger function. This will log all messages that the
socket sends and receives.
-}
startLogging : Model -> Cmd Msg
startLogging (Model model) =
    Socket.startLogging model.portConfig.phoenixSend


{-| Deactivate the socket's logger function.

stopLogging : Model -> Cmd Msg
